# CybouS3

**The Unified Swift Object Storage Ecosystem**

CybouS3 combines CybS3 (zero-knowledge encrypted S3 client) and SwiftS3 (S3-compatible server) into a comprehensive, secure, and enterprise-ready object storage solution built entirely in Swift.

## What We're Building

CybouS3 is pioneering a **unified ecosystem** that bridges the gap between secure client-side encryption and enterprise-grade server infrastructure. Our vision is to create the most secure, performant, and user-friendly object storage solution that maintains zero-trust principles while providing seamless integration.

### The Problem We're Solving
Traditional object storage solutions force a choice between:
- **Security**: Client-side encryption tools that are complex and disconnected
- **Usability**: Server solutions that handle everything but expose data risks

CybouS3 eliminates this tradeoff by providing **double encryption** (client + server) with unified management, making security the default while maintaining enterprise capabilities.

### Our Approach
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Your data is never exposed - not in transit, not at rest, not even to our servers
- **Unified Experience**: Single CLI for client operations, server management, and ecosystem coordination
- **Enterprise Ready**: Multi-tenant support, audit logging, compliance features, and scalability
- **Developer Friendly**: Easy local development setup, comprehensive testing, and cross-platform support

## Overview

CybouS3 is the first unified ecosystem that seamlessly integrates:

- **CybS3**: Advanced CLI client with zero-knowledge, client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
- **SwiftS3**: High-performance S3-compatible server with enterprise features

This combination delivers **double encryption** (client + server), unified management, and comprehensive testing - all while maintaining the zero-trust security model.

cybs3 vaults select dev
cybs3 files put myfile.txt --bucket my-bucket

# Run integration tests
cybs3 test integration

# Run security tests
cybs3 test security

# Run performance benchmarks (Coming Q3 2026)
cybs3 performance benchmark --swift-s3
```

### Development Workflow

### Current State (Q1 2026 ✅)
- ✅ CybS3 CLI with client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
- ✅ SwiftS3 S3-compatible server with enterprise features
- ✅ Basic integration commands (`cybs3 test`, `cybs3 vaults local`)
- ✅ Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)

### Coming Soon
- 🔄 **Q2 2026**: SSE-KMS bridge for double encryption
- 🔄 **Q3 2026**: Unified CLI server management (`cybs3 server start/stop`)
- 🔄 **Q4 2026**: Performance benchmarking and security testing frameworks
- 🔄 **2027**: Multi-cloud support, enterprise compliance, AI/ML features

## Components

### CybS3 CLI

## Security Model

### Encryption Layers
1. **Client-side AES-256-GCM** (always enabled in CybS3)
2. **Server-side KMS encryption** (optional, SwiftS3) - *Bridge coming Q2 2026*
3. **Transport encryption** (TLS 1.3)

### Zero-Knowledge Architecture
- **Your data is never exposed** - encrypted before leaving your device
- **BIP39 mnemonics** for deterministic key generation
- **Key rotation** without re-encryption of existing data
- **Secure key storage** using platform-specific secure storage (Keychain, etc.)

### Double Encryption Vision
CybouS3 will be the first ecosystem to offer **true double encryption**:
- **Layer 1**: Client-side encryption you control
- **Layer 2**: Server-side encryption for additional protection
- **Result**: Ultra-sensitive data gets maximum protection while maintaining usability

### Key Management
- **Hierarchical key derivation** from BIP39 mnemonics
- **AWS KMS integration** for server-side encryption
- **Key rotation workflows** that maintain data accessibility
- **Cross-platform secure storage** for credentials and keys
